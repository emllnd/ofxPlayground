# ofxPlayground

An OpenFrameworks addon that provides scene management and cross-platform support for a certain type of generative projects. Supports OSX and iOS for now.


### Examples

example-simple: contains two scenes that draw a box and a circle respectively and react to mouse input. Switching between scenes is provided by ofxPlayground so you can press any key to go from one scene to another.
